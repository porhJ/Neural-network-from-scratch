# Neural Network from Scratch
A simple neural network built from the ground up using only NumPy in Python.

## Motivation
This is a personal project I created to solidify my understanding of neural networks while studying the [Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction).

## Features
- Flexible architecture: customizable number of layers and neurons per layer
- Supports three activation functions: **ReLU**, **Sigmoid**, and **Linear**
- Data normalization included for improved training stability

## Learning Resources
These are the materials that helped me build this project:
- ðŸ“˜ **[Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)** â€“ My primary resource for understanding the theory and math.
- ðŸŽ¥ **[3Blue1Brown â€“ "But what is a neural network?" (Deep Learning Chapter 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)** â€“ Helped me intuitively understand backpropagation. Highly recommended!
